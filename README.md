# Python-Torch-Chess-Neural-Network-with-CPP-rendering
This project uses a Python-based Chess Neural Network to play against Stockfish in a Linux environment. If you want to switch it to Windows, you'll need to reinstall Stockfish and use the Windows version instead of the current Linux build.


 # You’ll also have to tweak the project a bit to make sure it works with the Windows Stockfish-this includes adjusting file paths and some platform-specific settings.#
